I'm Tom.  I am a proud husband, a new father (to be), and a recently appointed CTO at a wonderful company called Sundown Solutions.  I love music, good food and drink, and all things tech.  Alongside those interests I'm also discovering a new-found enjoyment in writing - it helps that I'm married to a Cambridge graduate who patiently proof reads whatever drivel I put in front of her!

I originally started this blog as a space for techie articles, but I've decided to forget this constraint.  I'm a firm believer that [writing is thinking](https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/), and my intention now is to use this site to help me process the vast number of lessons I'm bound to learn following the recent changes in my home and work life.  I don't know what topics I'll write about - or if I'll get round to any writing at all...and if that's the case, it's the thought that counts, right?
