I am a Technical Architect with a primary focus on Microsoft Azure and a penchant for all things PowerShell.  My background is in systems engineering which exposed me to a broad range of technologies, however more recently I have opted to specialise in cloud technology.  I started coding about 5 years ago when I started learning PowerShell to help with my day job, now I strive to spend as much of my day writing code or hacking around on the console as possible.

I started this blog for a couple of reasons: firstly, having been a beneficiary of the wealth of invaluable information published by people in the community for a number of years, I felt like it was time to make a contribution of my own.  Secondly, blogging about problems I've solved - big or small - will help me reflect on my work and remind me not to make the same mistakes more than once (yeah right).

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments about anything that appears on this site!
