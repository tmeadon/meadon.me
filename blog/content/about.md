I am a Technical Architect with a primary focus on Microsoft Azure and love of writing code.  My background in systems engineering exposed me to a broad range of technologies, however in the last few years I have opted to specialise in cloud technology - I find all aspects of cloud native system architecture fascinating.  I started coding about 5 years ago when I started learning PowerShell to help with my day job (actually that's a lie - I had to learn Fortran 95 at university), now I strive to spend as much of my day writing code or hacking around on the console as possible.  I especially enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, as well as playing around with the latest innovations in Azure.

I started this blog for a couple of reasons: firstly, having been a beneficiary of the wealth of invaluable information published by people in the community for a number of years, I felt like it was time to make a contribution of my own.  Secondly, blogging about problems I've solved - big or small - will help me reflect on my work and remind me not to make the same mistakes more than once (yeah right).

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments about anything that appears on this site!
